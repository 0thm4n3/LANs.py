intercept
========

Running just intercept.py without -ip argument will arp scan the network and give you a choice of targets then just arp spoof the target

Example:
./intercept.py -s -u -p -ip 192.168.0.10
Would print URLs visited, username/passwords entered, POSTs made, and all searches they make
